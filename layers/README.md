# ATT&CK Navigator Layers

A layer constitutes a set of annotations on the ATT&CK matrix for a specific technology domain. Layers can also store a default configuration of the view such as sorting, visible platforms, and more. The ATT&CK Navigator includes functionalities for exporting annotations into layer files, as well as the ability to import layer files for viewing.

See the latest [layer format specification](spec/v4.5/layerformat.md) for more information about Layer files.

## Sample Layers

This repository includes a couple of [sample layers](samples/) demonstrating example use cases of layers and the ATT&CK Navigator. The scripts used to generate these layer files can be found in the [mitreattack-python repository](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-scripts/tree/master/scripts/layers/samples). These scripts may serve as examples on how to access and work with [ATT&CK data](https://github.com/mitre/cti).
